# R-for-Med-EntryMLDL
Authors: alvin & adnan

_This repo is for an entry to Medical ML/DL training. Dr. Shafiq and me, we will start the practice here since Jul 2023_

## Programming Basic in R
alvin will start updating under this subtitle for warming up
### C1. Foundations of programming practice.
- Step 1: for the future, we have to start with some very basic stuff.

## Probability & Statistic Exercises in R
### C1. Real-world strategies.
- Step 1: after warming up, we can start with some Prob-based tasks to combine R programming with Probability & Statistics.

  _alvin will start uploading his Prob&Stat homework from Dr.Stewart's class. (Questions by Dr.Stewart, completed by alvin)_

## Visualization and statistical analysis in R
### C1. Plotting assistance for Dr. Shafiq's research
- Step 1: after our first meeting, adnan & alvin have planned to start with some basic tasks wrapping up for us.
