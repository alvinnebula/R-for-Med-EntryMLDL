Assignment 6

**Due Date**: 10/13/2021 at 11:59 pm CDT 

This is a **group** assignment. Person 1 will answer the questions in person_one.Rmd and person 2 will answer the questions in person_two.Rmd. 

You will be graded on the accuracy of your answers **as well as your use of GitHub Flow**. Person 1 should create an issue for answering the questions in person_one.Rmd. Make sure the issue clearly describes the work you will be doing. Person 1 must create their own branch to work on these questions. Once Person 1 finishes the questions, close the issue with a commit and create a pull request. Person 2 will then review the pull request and determine whether or not Person 1's work is correct. If it is correct, Person 2 should approve the pull request and merge the branch into main (master). 

If the code is not correct, Person 2 should leave a comment where corrections need to be made. Person 1 must then edit the code on their branch and make a new commit. This new commit will be automatically added to the pull request. Person 2 can then re-examine the code. Person 2 should approve the pull request and merge the code if it is now correct; if not, repeat this process. 

Person 2 should follow the same process with their own questions, with Person 1 reviewing their work. Remember to only merge in your partner's work if you are sure the code is correct! 

For the midterm, you will need to use GitHub Flow, so use this homework as practice! Refer to your feedback from assignment 1 and reach out to a TA if you have questions.
