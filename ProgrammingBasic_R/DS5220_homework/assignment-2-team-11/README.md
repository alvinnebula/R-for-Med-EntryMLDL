# Grammar of Data Manipulation

These exercises cover concepts covered in Chapter 5 of R for Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html). Please answer all the questions by using tidyverse grammar. Documentation of the functions you will use can be found in the dplyr package documentation (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). Do feel free to post questions on Slack as well. 

One additional helpful package will be janitor (https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), in particular the clean_names function. The data has columns names with spaces which is annoying to deal with--clean_names handles that. 

For each problem, create an issue with the text describing the problem. Use GH Flow (create a branch for each problem in turn, close with a commit message, and create a pull request that you yourself merge).

Work through the exercises in R4DS for extra practice, to get ideas on how to solve these problems. Ask questions on Slack, and be sure to attend office hours if you need assistance. 

Work all of the problems in transform-exercises.Rmd.
